Mario, be careful!
I have a bad
feeling about this...
/ airstrip: peach
Ow ow ow OW!
Not fair!
Completely unfair!
/ plaza2: sm01
You shouldn't be
allowed to use
tools like that!
/ plaza2: sm02
Dang it!
This ain't over!
/ gelato7: sm
It's me, Il Piantissimo!
And now, listen! See
that flag over there?
/ pianta2: piantissimoStart01
Now, you and I
shall race to get there
the fastest! Yes!
/ pianta2: piantissimoStart02
My personal record is
00:30:00
Impressive, eh?
/ pianta2: piantissimoStart03
Are you at the ready?
Then get set!
AND GOOOOOOOO!!
/ pianta2: piantissimoStart04
Grrrr! Yes, GRRRR!
That was not so bad!
You are quick! Yes!
/ pianta2: piantissimoEnd01
I suppose, maybe I
underestimated you
a small bit. Perhaps.
/ pianta2: piantissimoEnd02
You try again after
you have practiced
more. Until then...
/ pianta2: piantissimoEnd03
Whew! You saved me!
Thanks a bundle!
/ pianta3: mayor
Oh, no!
I just went away for
a bit and now look...
/ pianta6: mayorStart01
I can't believe it!
Another fine mess!
And it's a doozy!
/ pianta6: mayorStart02
Some of the villagers
are trapped in that
burning ooze!
/ pianta6: mayorStart03
And I just finished
evacuating everyone
a little while back!
/ pianta6: mayorStart04
What in the world's
happening? I think I
may just start crying.
/ pianta6: mayorStart05
I'm sorry to trouble
you time after time,
but please...
/ pianta6: mayorStart06
Could you find the
time to help us
out again?
/ pianta6: mayorStart07
Ten villagers are
trapped in the slime.
You must hurry!
/ pianta6: mayorStart08
You're the savior of
Pianta Village!
We're in your debt!
/ pianta6: mayorEnd01
As a reward, please
take this!
/ pianta6: mayorEnd02
Aaarrgh!
I'll remember this!
/ pianta7: sm
Amazing! What a
spectacle! Is this a
new show of ours?!
/ pinna1: director01
You guys are great!
Whoever hired you
needs a raise!
/ pinna1: director02
I love how you play
the fearless hero and
he's like...
/ pinna1: director03
a bad version of you,
but you both look the
same and stuff!!
/ pinna1: director04
Well, as director of
this park, I want to
ensure your success.
/ pinna1: director05
So, how about I
provide you with a
hero's vehicle?
/ pinna1: director06
Follow me!
/ pinna1: director07
Darn it all!
I'll remember this!
/ pinna7: sm
Wahoooo!
You wanna go for
a ride, bud?
/ ricco2: raceguy01
Go ahead and jump
on the Blooper you
like best. Go on!
/ ricco2: raceguy02
Show me some super
Blooper-surfing, and
win yourself a prize!
/ ricco2: raceguy03
Phooey!
I'll remember this!
/ ricco7: sm
Arrgh!
I'll remember this!!
/ bianco7: sm
Darn! And I was
just about to ride
that Yoshi, too!
/ plaza6: yoshiSM
Oh, please tell me
my nightmare is over!
You can save me!
/ sirena1: manager01
I don't know why, but
you just look very...
capable to me.
/ sirena1: manager02
Listen...it all started
around noon. This
giant manta-shaped...
/ sirena1: manager03
...thing showed up. It
was this paper-thin...
floating silhouette.
/ sirena1: manager04
It came and covered
the hotel grounds in
this electric goop.
/ sirena1: manager05
Then... Oh, the horror!
My beautiful hotel!
My poor building!
/ sirena1: manager06
It sank in the middle
of that awful ooze!
Why me? WHY???
/ sirena1: manager07
Now, I've got the staff
cleaning up, but
where's my hotel?
/ sirena1: manager08
What am I supposed
to do? I can't just
sit back and...
/ sirena1: manager09
AIIIIGH! It's back!
That gossamer ghoul!
Do something!
/ sirena1: manager10
Hey! Ummmmm...
It's...Mario, right?
Yeah. Mario.
/ sirena2: manager01
Listen, I, uh, have a
feeling you can
help me out again...
/ sirena2: manager02
See, the hotel, it's...
Well, it's full of...
It's full of ghosts!
/ sirena2: manager03
So, well, could you
maybe... Look, just
come inside, please.
/ sirena2: manager04
I can tell you're a
miracle worker.
Don't be so modest.
/ sirena2: manager05
Ahhh, dear Mario!
Please, come right in!
/ sirena3: manager01
Do I sense some
reluctance? Come
now, don't dawdle.
/ sirena3: manager02
Well now, Mario!
You really should
drop by the casino.
/ sirena4: manager01
I'll let my boys
know you're coming.
Go on, now!
/ sirena4: manager02
Ahh, Mario! Right this
way, please!
/ sirena4: worker
Ah! Mario! Mario!
The casino's this way!
Well, actually...
/ sirena5: manager01
I must admit that,
unfortunately, the
casino's closed today.
/ sirena5: manager02
You see, there are
creepy sounds coming
from the basement...
/ sirena5: manager03
Could we trick you...
I mean, ask for your
help? Oh, thank you!
/ sirena5: manager04
Ahh, Mario! Right this
way, please!
/ sirena5: worker
Mario! We've
got trouble!
/ sirena6: managerStart01
That electric goop
is back! Where?
Everywhere!
/ sirena6: managerStart02
Wow! That was great!
I never expected you
to do it so easily.
/ sirena6: managerEnd01
Fantastic, Mario!
/ sirena6: managerEnd02
Ah! Mario! There's a
troublemaker inside
who looks like you!
/ sirena7: manager01
Hurry! Get in there!
/ sirena7: manager02
Yaaaaargh!
You're so annoying!
/ sirena7: sm
I've got it! Yes!
I surely do have it!
What have I got?
/ noki3: elder01
Why, the answer to
our polluted ocean
problem, of course!
/ noki3: elder02
And the answer is
you! You must go to
the ocean floor!
/ noki3: elder03
Of course, that is
impossible for you
at the moment...
/ noki3: elder04
Therefore, I've made
an area for you to
hone your skills!
/ noki3: elder05
Boop-bop-boop-
bottle-dee-BOO!
Tah-daaa!
/ noki3: elder06
Wear this, and you
can stay underwater
for much, much longer!
/ noki3: elder07
Use that FLUDD to
move around and
get red coins.
/ noki3: elder08
But don't overdo it!
If you run low on air,
here's what you do...
/ noki3: elder09
Just grab some
regular coins to refill
your meter, OK?
/ noki3: elder10
Now, shall we get
started?
/ noki3: elder11
Oh, Mario! You're
finally setting out for
the ocean's bottom!
/ noki4: youth01
Grandpa is waiting for
you up top. Oh, don't
forget to wear this...
/ noki4: youth02
You can use this rope
as a shortcut to
reach Grandpa...
/ noki4: youth03
Ho HO, foolish man!
I am Il Piantissimo!
Yes, that is me!
/ noki5: piantissimoStart01
And now, I challenge
you to a race to
that flag!
/ noki5: piantissimoStart02
It is a race to the
finish! The best time
is 00:40:00.
/ noki5: piantissimoStart03
Are you at the ready?
Then get set...
and GOOOOOOOOO!
/ noki5: piantissimoStart04
Whoo...haah...wheeze!
You are quite speedy!
You are like a fish!
/ noki5: piantissimoEnd01
You may not be the
slow clam-chomper
I took you for!
/ noki5: piantissimoEnd02
May we race again!
Watch for me!
/ noki5: piantissimoEnd03
Curses!
I won't forget this!
